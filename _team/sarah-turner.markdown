Sarah Turner is the Senior Administrative Assistant for Professor Kevin Fu and the Archimedes Center for Medical Device Security. Sarah works from her home in New Orleans, but don't let the fact that she lives in the Big Easy fool you—she is extremely driven and organized and she loves nothing more than to cross tasks off her Trello list. Sarah earned her BA in Business Administration from Davenport University and is currently working toward an MBA. She has over eight years of experience working in fast-paced environments ranging from managing a tech-driven educational startup that teaches kids how to code to organizing the food assistance programs for a local farmer’s market. Motivated by work that makes a difference, Sarah is proud to be an integral member of the Archimedes team and is available to answer any questions you may have about Archimedes or its membership opportunities. Just email her at archimedes@umich.edu and she’ll tell you what you need to know.
